# observable-fns

Light-weight observable implementation (< 7kB minified) and utils. Based on [`zen-observable`](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable), re-implemented in TypeScript.

Philosophy: Keep the observable implementation itself minimal, ship the utility methods that are on the `Observable` constructor in RxJS as separate functions that can be imported as needed.
